# Gitignore
Play with gitignore rules
### What is a Gitignore?
Gitignore file tells Git which files to ignore when committing your project to the GitHub repository. gitignore is located in the root directory of your repo. The .gitignore file itself is a plain text document.
### How does the Gitignore work?
Gitignore file is a plain text file where each line contains a pattern for files/directories to ignore. Generally, this is placed in the root folder of the repository, and that's what is recommend. However, you can put it in any folder in the repository and you can also have multiple .gitignore files.
### When should I use Gitignore?
When Do You Use Git Ignore File? The git ignore file rule allows you to ignore a file you've committed in the past. You use it when you do not want to recommit a file, for example a build artifact.
### What should be included in Gitignore?
gitignore should list the names or name-patterns of files that will be found in work-trees when working with your project, but that should not be committed to the project. In other words, it's not OS-specific, it's project-specific.
